The Dreamcast Codes seem to match Exactly as shown on the GameHacking Site and
the CodeTink Site. It may only show xxXXXXXX , but if it matches what the Code should
be for the rest of it, you are good.

Not sure why I cant get the Android Build of Reicast working. Keeps Crashing
on me. But the PC Build (Windows x64) seems to be working perfectly. Was able
to create a few MvsC2 Codes with no Issues. Figure I will keep creating them, then
when the Android Build starts working again, will have Codes for a few Games.

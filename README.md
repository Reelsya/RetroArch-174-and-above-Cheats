# RetroArch-174-and-above-Cheats
Cheats for CPS1 and CPS2 Games under FBA Core/s

Note: Sometimes, depending on the Game, it will not follow a Hex Value. There are those Games where the Value must match, for example, the Time Remaining like in X-Men-COTA

Games or Cores that do NOT work when trying to Search for Cheats. To be Continued

Problem: You Initiate a Search. You return to the Game, and get hit, or let the Game Time run down. You go back into the Search and go to the Values or Less Than and try to enter that......but it says the Search has not yet been Initiated.....but you just did earlier!!!! So until there is a fix, so far, these Games/Roms will not work with the RetroArch Cheat Search/Creation Tool

Mortal Kombat 3 Games, Including UMK3
Fighters History will Crash RetroArch

FBA 2012 Cores can not have Cheats Made for some reason. I have tested CPS1, 
CPS2 and the FBA2012 Cores. Get the same Error about the Search has not been
Started yet, when I did. 
Also, trying to Load up FBA Cheats (Current Build Core) will Crash the App.

MAME2003 and 2003+ will not Start a Cheat Search as well. Just use the 0.78, 0.81 or possibly the 126 Cheat File for now.

PrBoom still will not allow for Cheat Search to start

DOSBox CAN start a Cheat Search, so if you have everything working, you can create Cheats possibly.
Just wondering how to get it Setup on the Vita
